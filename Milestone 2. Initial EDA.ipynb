    "###### Question 1: When reviewing the first few rows of the dataframe, what do you observe about the data? What does each row represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Upon reviewing the first few rows of the dataframe, it is clear that each row represents an individual video claim made by an author. The claim_status column indicates the status of the claim and the video_id is a unique identifier for each video. The video_duration_sec column shows the length of the video in seconds, and the video_transcription_text provides a brief summary or transcription related to the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Other columns include verified_status, which indicates whether the claim has been verified or not, and author_ban_status, which reflects the ban status of the author. Additionally, the dataframe includes engagement metrics like video_view_count, video_like_count, video_share_count, video_download_count, and video_comment_count, which show the level of interaction or engagement with each video.\n",

    "Question 2: When reviewing the data.info() output, what do you notice about the different variables? Are there any null values? Are all of the variables numeric? Does anything else stand out?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Upon reviewing the data.info() output, it is noticeable that not all variables are numeric. The dataframe contains variables of different data types: int64, float64, and object. Specifically, the columns claim_status, video_transcription_text, verified_status, and author_ban_status are of type object, while the rest are numeric (int64 for counts and durations, and float64 for video interaction metrics).\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are some null values present in the data. The claim_status, video_transcription_text, and several video interaction columns (video_view_count, video_like_count, video_share_count, video_download_count, video_comment_count) have missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    One other point to note is the memory usage of the dataframe, which is 1.8+ MB, indicating that the dataset contains a considerable amount of data (19,382 entries). The missing values in key interaction metrics may need to be addressed during the data cleaning or preprocessing steps.\n",

    "Question 3: When reviewing the data.describe() output, what do you notice about the distributions of each variable? Are there any questionable values? Does it seem that there are outlier values?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Upon reviewing the data.describe() output, several observations can be made regarding the distributions of the variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The video duration (video_duration_sec) ranges from a minimum of 5 seconds to a maximum of 60 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The video_view_count column shows a highly skewed distribution, with a mean of 254,708 but a median of only 9,954.5, indicating that a few viral videos drive up the average. The max value of 999,817 suggests extreme outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The video_like_count also exhibits skewness, with a mean of 84,304 and a median of 3,403.5, meaning most videos receive relatively few likes while a handful accumulate extremely high engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The video_share_count follows a similar pattern, with a median of 717 compared to a mean of 16,735, showing that a small number of videos receive a disproportionate number of shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The video_comment_count is similarly skewed, with a median of 46 but a mean of 1,049, suggesting that a few highly discussed videos dominate the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The presence of zeros in video_share_count, video_download_count, and video_comment_count suggests that some videos receive minimal interaction, possibly indicating lower relevance or engagement.\n"

This suggests that banned authors' videos tend to attract much more attention and are viewed more frequently, possibly due to their controversial content.\n",

This further supports the idea that banned content often generates more engagement, likely driven by heightened curiosity or debate.\n",

This indicates that banned authors’ videos are being shared much more widely, potentially due to their provocative nature or the discussions they generate.\n",
